Display property in CSS: 
	In HTML, there are three types of elements: 
		1. block element (takes up the entire line) (e.g. p element)
		2. inline-block element (only takes as much space as needed) (e.g. img element)
		3. inline element (appears within a line of text) (e.g. span element)

Nested Layout Technique:
	Two types of layouts:
		1. Vertical Layout
		2. Horizontal Layout

Inline Styles: Writing CSS inside html lines.

<div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:100px 1fr;></div>   ==> Here, fr is 1 free space

Flexbox is similar to CSS grid for creating layouts but it is more flexible.
