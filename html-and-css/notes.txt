Display property in CSS: 
	In HTML, there are three types of elements: 
		1. block element (takes up the entire line) (e.g. p element)
		2. inline-block element (only takes as much space as needed) (e.g. img element)
		3. inline element (appears within a line of text) (e.g. span element)

Nested Layout Technique:
	Two types of layouts:
		1. Vertical Layout
		2. Horizontal Layout

Inline Styles: Writing CSS inside html lines.

<div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:100px 1fr;></div>   ==> Here, fr is 1 free space

Flexbox is similar to a CSS grid for creating layouts but is more flexible.

CSS Specificity: Specificity determines which CSS rules are applied by giving different weights to different types of selectors, with more specific selectors overriding less specific ones.

CSS Inheritance: Inheritance allows certain CSS properties to be passed down from parent elements to their child elements, unless explicitly overridden.

Semantic Elements: Semantic elements in HTML provide meaning about the content to both the browser and search engine robots, enhancing accessibility and SEO by clearly defining the role of the content on a webpage. For example, <header> defines introductory content or navigation links, <article> represents a self-contained piece of content, <footer> marks the bottom section typically containing metadata or links, <nav> indicates a set of navigation links, <section> defines a thematic grouping of content, and <aside> represents content related to the main content, like sidebars or callouts.
